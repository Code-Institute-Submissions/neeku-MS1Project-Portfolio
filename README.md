# NEEKU SHAMEKHI'S PORTFOLIO WEBSITE
## Description
This is a portfolio website created for my first Milestone Project.

The purpose of this website is to provide information on who I am and what services I can deliver by providing my CV, and letting people to contact me.

I have tried to keep it simple. The website is split into 3 main pages:

- Home: An Introduction to me with links to my social media profiles.
- About: Information on who I am and what I do.
- Contact: A form to contact me for recruiting or any other purposes.
- There is also a link to a downloadable version of my CV.

## User Experience (UX)

This site is a personal portfolio for myself.

The page layout is responsive; it has a left side vertical menu bar for larger displays which switches to a horizontal top navigation bar in smaller displays where the menu item names are hidden and only the relevant icons are displayed.

For further enhancement of the website and to make it distinguishable when there are many open tabs, a favicon with my initials is added. 

Background images are my own photographs.
